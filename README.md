My approach to AI collaboration

## 1) How I Used AI During the Project

I worked with AI step by step throughout the **WeatherWise** assignment. I used AI to:

* **Explore tools:** I asked how to use the `WeatherWrapper` and `hands-on-ai` packages.
* **Develop natural language parsing:** I asked AI for multiple ways English speakers might ask about needing an umbrella, so my program could handle different phrasings.
* **Improve usability:** I prompted AI to make the console interface clearer and more user-friendly. e.g.)It shows ASCII.
* **Debug code:** I shared error messages with the AI, and it explained the cause and gave corrected versions.

The first and most difficult task was to understand the WeatherWrapper tool—its characteristics, how much effort it would take to use, and how it actually worked.
To grasp this, I needed to see what the user console looked like.
So, right after receiving the initial code, I asked the AI how I could view and use the console.

After all, seeing is the foundation of thinking.

## 2) How I Guided AI When Its First Answer Wasn’t Perfect

I didn’t just accept the first code it gave me. Instead, I:

* Asked AI to **explain its code** before I ran it, to check if I understood.
* Pointed out **specific problems** (like mismatches between dictionary keys or undefined functions).
* Challenged AI with **edge cases** (for example, asking about different question types, not just “rain or no rain”).
* Requested **refinements** to both the code and the console output to make it more practical.

## 3) Examples of Improvement

Here are some concrete examples:

* **Before:** AI first gave me only one umbrella phrases.
  **My Prompt:** “Can you suggest 5 phrases an English speaker might use?”
  **After:** AI expanded the list to 5 varied natural expressions.

* **Before:** AI’s initial mapping of weather question outputs (`left side`) didn’t match the number of `right side` elements, causing a key error.
  **My Prompt:** I asked AI to identify why the mismatch happened.
  **After:** AI explained the bug and fixed the dictionary structure so left and right matched properly.

Would you like me to **draft a polished README.md skeleton** with these points already structured under proper headings (e.g., *AI Collaboration Approach*, *Examples of Prompting*, *Lessons Learned*) so you can directly paste it into your GitHub?
