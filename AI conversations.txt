Explored how to use the WeatherWrapper

(Me)
In google colab, I tried the following code. And got an error like the picture.
What assumptions are you making about this error?


#Install packages in the first cell:

 !pip -q install pyinputplus fetch-my-weather hands-on-ai

 def get_weather_data(location, days=2):
    """Return structured weather for location using fetch-my-weather."""
    # e.g., from fetch_my_weather import WeatherWrapper
    # ww = WeatherWrapper()
    # return ww.forecast(location=location, days=days)
    pass

def parse_weather_question(question):
    """Return dict: {'location':..., 'when':..., 'intent':...} using hands-on-ai."""
    # e.g., from hands_on_ai import nlp
    # parse to intents: rain?, cold?, picnic?, clothing?, umbrella?
    pass

def generate_weather_response(parsed, weather):
    """Map parsed intent + data to a helpful natural-language answer."""
    pass

From the screenshot and your code snippet, here are the assumptions I’m making about why you got
`IndentationError: unexpected indent` in Colab:

1. **You indented the first function definition (`def get_weather_data...`) after the `!pip` line.**
   In Python, top-level statements (like a function definition) must start at the far left of the cell unless they are inside a class or another function.
   Your `def` line appears to have one or more spaces before it.

2. **Colab treats `!pip` as a shell command, but extra indentation after it is still read by Python.**
   If you indent your `def` after a shell command in the same cell, Python will think you’re trying to define a function inside something else — which isn’t valid here.

3. **Possible mixed indentation (spaces + tabs)** might also be triggering the error if you pasted code from somewhere else.
   Python is very strict: indentation must be consistent.

---

**Fix:**

* Put the `!pip install ...` in its own cell (no indentation before the bang `!` and no Python code indented after it).
* Start your `def ...` lines at column 0 in a new cell.

Example:

```python
# Cell 1: Install packages
!pip -q install pyinputplus fetch-my-weather hands-on-ai
```

```python
# Cell 2: Function definitions
def get_weather_data(location, days=2):
    """Return structured weather for location using fetch-my-weather."""
    pass

def parse_weather_question(question):
    """Return dict: {'location':..., 'when':..., 'intent':...} using hands-on-ai."""
    pass

def generate_weather_response(parsed, weather):
    """Map parsed intent + data to a helpful natural-language answer."""
    pass
```

---

If you want, I can rewrite your **install + functions** in a clean Colab-ready format so you can copy-paste without indentation issues.


Developed the natural language processing for weather questions

(Me)
How does an english speaker say
when they want to know whether they need an umbrella?

I want 5 phrases other than
'Should I take an umbrella?

(AI)
Here are 5 natural phrases an English speaker might use to ask about needing an umbrella (besides “Should I take an umbrella?”):

“Do I need an umbrella today?”

“Will I need an umbrella later?”

“Is it going to rain enough that I should bring an umbrella?”

“Should I carry an umbrella with me?”

“Do you think I’ll get caught in the rain without an umbrella?”


Improved the user interface with AI assistance

(Background)
At first, our program only showed:

Please select one of the following:
1. Enter location
2. Ask a weather question
3. Exit

(Me)
Currently, the program shows;
-------------------------------------------
- Temperature: 16°C
- Rain: 0.0 mm
- Condition: Clear 

-------------------------------------------

Next, I want something like; 

-------------------------------------------   
- Temperature: 16°C
- Rain: 0.0 mm
- Condition: Clear 

      \   /      
       .-.       
    ― (   ) ―      
       `-’      
      /   \     
-------------------------------------------

In short, I want the following;
      \   /      
       .-.       
    ― (   ) ―      
       `-’      
      /   \     
Please check this in wttr.in. This varies according to Conditions.

(AI)
Got it — you’d like the weather console output to include ASCII art icons (like wttr.in does) 
corresponding to the current condition.

We can refine Cell 5 to map conditions (Clear, Cloudy, Rain, etc.) to ASCII icons.

Here’s a refined Cell 5:

In the console, I got a following error.
Firstly, of which part is this issue?
a)to use the WeatherWrapper, b)language process, c)user interface with AI assistance d)Refine the code

Umbrella Assistant

Enter a location (City or Country): Perth
Ask your umbrella question (e.g., 'Do I need an umbrella tomorrow?'):
> Do I need an umbrella tomorrow?

(AI)
Great catch. This error is in (d) Refine the code — specifically our summary helper that formats the “weather in … : …” line. wttr.in sometimes gives a non-numeric time, and my code tried to do int('—'), which blows up.
What happened
_best_rain_hour() can return a placeholder time ('—') when no good hour was found.


_day_summary() then does int(t_best) to find the nearest hourly block → ValueError.


Quick fix (drop-in updates for Cell 4)
Replace your _best_rain_hour() and _day_summary() with these safer versions:
def _best_rain_hour(hourly):
    """
    From hourly list, return the hour block with the highest rain signal.
    Returns (chance%, precip_mm, time_int_or_None)
    """
    best = (0, 0.0, None)
    for h in hourly:
        try:
            chance = int(h.get("chanceofrain", h.get("chanceofprecip", "0")) or 0)
        except Exception:
            chance = 0
        try:
            precip = float(h.get("precipMM", 0) or 0.0)
        except Exception:
            precip = 0.0
        # wttr 'time' is "0","300","600",... but sometimes missing/odd
        t_raw = h.get("time", None)
        try:
            t_val = int(str(t_raw)) if t_raw is not None else None
        except Exception:
            t_val = None

        if (chance, precip) > (best[0], best[1]):
            best = (chance, precip, t_val)
    return best

def _day_summary(day_block: dict) -> str:
    """Compact summary for the chosen day (condition, temps, wind)."""
    # Try daily min/max; fall back to N/A
    maxt = day_block.get("maxtempC") or day_block.get("MaxTempC") or "N/A"
    mint = day_block.get("mintempC") or day_block.get("MintempC") or "N/A"

    # Rainiest hour & representative conditions
    need, chance, precip, t_best = _needs_umbrella_for_day(day_block)
    hourly = day_block.get("hourly", [])

    # Choose representative hour safely
    rep = None
    if hourly:
        if t_best is None:
            rep = hourly[0]  # just take the first available hour
        else:
            def safe_int(x):
                try:
                    return int(str(x))
                except Exception:
                    return None
            def dist(h):
                t = safe_int(h.get("time"))
                return abs(t - t_best) if (t is not None and t_best is not None) else 10**9
            rep = min(hourly, key=dist)

    cond = (rep.get("weatherDesc", [{"value": "N/A"}])[0]["value"]) if rep else "N/A"
    wind_dir = rep.get("winddir16Point", "—") if rep else "—"
    wind_kmh = rep.get("WindspeedKmph", "—") if rep else "—"

    return f"{cond}; {mint}–{maxt}°C; wind {wind_dir} {wind_kmh} km/h; rain peak ~{chance}% (~{precip} mm)"

You don’t need to change any other cells. After this update:
Missing/odd times won’t crash the program.


If there’s no clear “best time,” it just uses the first hourly entry.


Run again with:
run_umbrella_console()

If you’d like, I can also add a tiny helper to format the “peak time” nicely (e.g., 06:00, 12:00) but keep it robust when time is missing.
